 * @param data The data to be set. Either a string or  {@link Office.CoercionType} value, 2d array or TableData object.
 * 
 * If the value passed for `data` is:
 * 
 * - A string: Plain text or anything that can be coerced to a string will be inserted. 
 * In Excel, you can also specify data as a valid formula to add that formula to the selected cell. For example, setting data to "=SUM(A1:A5)" 
 * will total the values in the specified range. However, when you set a formula on the bound cell, after doing so, you can't read the added 
 * formula (or any pre-existing formula) from the bound cell. If you call the Document.getSelectedDataAsync method on the selected cell to 
 * read its data, the method can return only the data displayed in the cell (the formula's result).
 * 
 * - An array of arrays ("matrix"): Tabular data without headers will be inserted. For example, to write data to three rows in two columns, 
 * you can pass an array like this: [["R1C1", "R1C2"], ["R2C1", "R2C2"], ["R3C1", "R3C2"]]. To write a single column of three rows, pass an 
 * array like this: [["R1C1"], ["R2C1"], ["R3C1"]]
 * 
 * In Excel, you can also specify data as an array of arrays that contains valid formulas to add them to the selected cells. For example if no 
 * other data will be overwritten, setting data to [["=SUM(A1:A5)","=AVERAGE(A1:A5)"]] will add those two formulas to the selection. Just as 
 * when setting a formula on a single cell as "text", you can't read the added formulas (or any pre-existing formulas) after they have been 
 * set - you can only read the formulas' results.
 * 
 * - A TableData object: A table with headers will be inserted.
 * In Excel, if you specify formulas in the TableData object you pass for the data parameter, you might not get the results you expect due to 
 * the "calculated columns" feature of Excel, which automatically duplicates formulas within a column. To work around this when you want to 
 * write `data` that contains formulas to a selected table, try specifying the data as an array of arrays (instead of a TableData object), and 
 * specify the coercionType as Microsoft.Office.Matrix or "matrix". However, this technique will block the "calculated columns" feature only 
 * when one of the following conditions is met: (1) you are writing to all the cells of the column, or (2) there are already at least two 
 * different formulas in the column.
 * @param options Provides options for how to insert data to the selection.
 * @param callback Optional. A function that is invoked when the callback returns, whose only parameter is of type {@link Office.AsyncResult}.
 * The AsyncResult.value property always returns undefined because there is no object or data to retrieve.

 * The Entities object is a container for the entity arrays returned by the getEntities and getEntitiesByType methods when the item 
 * (either an email message or an appointment) contains one or more entities that have been found by the server. 
 * You can use these entities in your code to provide additional context information to the viewer, such as a map to an address found in the item, 
 * or to open a dialer for a phone number found in the item.
 * 
 * If no entities of the type specified in the property are present in the item, the property associated with that entity is null. 
 * For example, if a message contains a street address and a phone number, the addresses property and phoneNumbers property would contain 
 * information, and the other properties would be null.
 * 
 * To be recognized as an address, the string must contain a United States postal address that has at least a subset of the elements of a street 
 * number, street name, city, state, and zip code.
 * 
 * To be recognized as a phone number, the string must contain a North American phone number format.
 * 
 * Entity recognition relies on natural language recognition that is based on machine learning of large amounts of data. 
 * The recognition of an entity is non-deterministic and success sometimes relies on the particular context in the item.
 * 
 * When the property arrays are returned by the getEntitiesByType method, only the property for the specified entity contains data;
