 * `$routeChangeSuccess` event is fired. If any of the promises are rejected the `$routeChangeError` event

 * For easier access to the resolved dependencies from the template, the `resolve` map will be available on

 * property (see below). This can be particularly useful, when working with components as route templates.
 * 
 * > **Note:** If your scope already contains a property with this name, it will be hidden or overwritten.
 * > Make sure, you specify an appropriate name for this property, that does not collide with other
 * > properties on the scope.
 * 
 * The map object is:
 * 
 * - `key` â€“ `{string}`: a name of a dependency to be injected into the controller.
 * - `factory` - `{string|Function}`: If `string` then it is an alias for a service. Otherwise if function,
 *    then it is called with `$injector#invoke()` and the return value is treated as the dependency. If the
 *    result is a promise, it is resolved before its value is injected into the controller. Be aware that
 *    `ngRoute.$routeParams` will still refer to the previous route within these resolve functions.  Use
 *    `$route.current.params` to access the new route parameters, instead.
